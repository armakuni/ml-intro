# Intro to Machine Learning

This repo will give an initial intro into how to train a machine learning model using some sample data.
## Getting started

### Pre-requisites

You will need:
- Python (has been tested with 3.9.15)
- A python IDE (has been tested with VSCode)
- Poetry

### Installation

To install the dependencies, open a terminal and type `poetry install` followed by `poetry shell`. This should create a virtual environment and install the required libs.

All being well, your IDE should detect the virtual environment and ask you if you want to use it. If not, open `iris.ipynb` (which is a Jupyter notebook) and select the kernel to be your current virtual environment.

### Exercise

The goal of this session is to work through the `iris.ipynb` notebook. You can tap shift+enter to run the cells.

As a stretched target, can you get the model to perform better? For example, improving the data and/or the choice of algorithm. Hint: we don't need a deep neural network.
